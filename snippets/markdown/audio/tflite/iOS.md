## Try your model with TFLite sample app

You can test your TensorFlow Lite sound classification model on iOS by following these steps:

1. Download the [sample app](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/sound_classification/iOS)
 from GitHub.
1. Extract the ZIP archive that you download from Teachable Machine.
1. Copy the `soundclassifier.tflite` and `labels.txt` files from the archive to the
 `Model` folder in the sample app, replacing the demo model there.

 *Note: Please use a physical iOS device to run the sample app.*
